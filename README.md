During this assignment, I did use ChatGPT as a helper to debug some of my cells, however the code is mine and authentic. 

# SUMMARY
The code analyzes the difference between charter and district schools looking into the passing rate of reading, math and the sum of both. The filter to determine which is better are the spending budget, the size of the school and the type of school. 

# Analysis
Based on the findings:

The highest performing schools by overall passing percentages are overwhelmingly the charter schools, and of course, by deduction, the district schools are the lowest by far. 

Based on the spending rates per student at both types of schools, the charter schools have less money invested per student than the district schools. This is surprising because the district schools, overall, have a much larger student base than the charter schools.

Based on the findings during this analysis, it is obvious that the charter schools are the more efficient with funds and produce a higher score per student overall. The size of the school has a direct corrolation to the scores as the smaller the school, the higher the scores. The spending has a similar corrolation as it seems the less spent per student, the higher the scores are as well. The more spent, the lower the overall scores. By an overwhelming majority throughout this analysis, the charter school is the undisputed champion.
